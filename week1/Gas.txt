  Gas price 
    - quantity, 
    - set by the sender, 
    - higher the gas price faster the addition to 
    
Gas price calculation
  - Every EVM's function execution is broken into assembly operations and every assembly operation has some gas cost.

  Gas price => is the value set by sender 
  Total gas cost => Sum of all assembly operation gas cost
    Tx fees = Gas price * Total gas cost

  - User can also set the max gas cost (Gas limit)
  Tx fees = Gas price * Min( Total gas cost, Gas limit )
