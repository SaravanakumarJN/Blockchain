  - It's persistent (stores in blockchain) and can be used later
  - Mostly used for state variables in contract and pointer's for state variables inside a function


Memory (runtime memory)
  - Can be used for read variables
  - Can be used inside the function as well as argument for function


Calldata (runtime memory)
  - Can be used for read variables
  - Can be used only for function arguments (consumes less gas fees)

Stack (runtime memory)
  - Runtime memory for "static" variables declared inside a function 
  - There is limit for static variable (of type stack) that can be declared in a function.

Built in variables in Solidity
